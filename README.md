## Requirements

SASS for building stylesheets https://sass-lang.com/install and Browserify for building javascript https://github.com/browserify/browserify

Watch the stylesheets using

```bash
sass --watch styles:dist
```

Convert the javascript using

```bash
# TODO add file watching so that you only have to run it once
browserify scripts/main.js > dist/index.js
```
